# KiCAD2Python
A basic parser from KiCAD files to Python objects.

## Requirements
The code had been developed and tested using:
- Python 3.6.1
- [sexpdata](https://pypi.org/project/sexpdata/) 0.0.3 package
- KiCAD 6.0.5

## Known Issues
This project is under development and it has few issues that make it not functional yet:
- Only schematic files can be parsed at the moment.
- Indentation not correct.
- Incomplete parse of the file.

## Related Projects
If you already have Python 3.10, have a look at [this](https://github.com/mvnmgrx/kiutils) project, it's basically the same idea, but it already covers all KiCAD 6.0 files!
